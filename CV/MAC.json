      "description": "Hello! My Name is Jose and I’m a Frontend Developer from Granada. \n\nAfter the first line with the TLDR; you can find about my professional life on the experience section. I speak there deeply about projects and what tools and language I use as developer, but about my “likes” I have to say that I know lot of people dislike JavaScript but I really like it, I know can be a mess, but also it’s very flexible and that match with me, and you can do very good code in JS if you have the knowledge and learn about good practice, other languages ensure that you have to follow, but this lack on JS make you have to read and be up to date, and that is a good things.\n\nAlso love CSS, I spent a lot of time “fighting” with it in the old times, with Internet Explorer 6 in all his gracious, but that endure you, I know can be difficult and frustrating sometimes, but again at the end it’s a very handy tool for designing UIs.\n\nFar from works and keyboard, I’m the husband of an incredible woman, Elia, and also the father of a little “devil” Alejandro who is the joy or our life’s. They are the more important thing in my life and I always try to be with them as much as possible, I decline lot of offer from other cities and countries, even very good one, because I want to be with my family everyday, don’t want to just see them on weekends or things like that.\n\nMy hobbies are, apart from coding, because we developer sure are crazy, are Swimming, Basketball and video games. \n\nI try to go swimming 3 days a week, and swim about 1,5km each. Swimming is the sport that most disconnects me from work and put my brain in new clear state, if I have a bad day and my head is full of work problem I just start swimming and when I finish it's gone. \n\nI play basketball since I was 5, it's my favourite sport, but today It's difficult to play it, have no time or people don't want to join me, you know football country, so I have to settle watching the NBA.\n\nAbout video games, I like it a lot since I was a kid playing with a SNES. I'm and old school player and prefer the single player games, like God of war, The last of us or Dark Souls. I spent less time that I want here, because Alejandro don't let us a lot of free time, but I will wait for the retirement.\n\nAlso I like technology in general, read articles and listen podcasts about it, also have to admit that I have a problem with Mechanical Keyboards and always is a good time to buy a new one with that new switch everybody is talking about.\n\nAnother of my favourite thing in life is travel. I have the luck to travel a lot but always less than I like, with the baby we have to pause a bit our travels, but we are willing to take a plane and look for a new country. \n\nI think that's all, hope this \"introduction\" it's not to big, and thanks all for the time",

But mainly it old good plain JS, HTML and CSS\n\nIn NGA I work in more side project, like a Mobile version of EuHReka, we start using Backbone, and with the years move it to Cordova/Ionic.\n\nAfter the EuHReka, I join to the FWK team of a new project hrX, what pretend to be a connection between HRIS with a conversational HR bot. In the technical side we did it with Angular (formerly Angular 2+), our own version of Bootstrap and for “shared component” with other product we use WebComponent with Stencil.\n\nGood things I can say about NGA, but also my partners there are awesome, I really enjoy my time with them. Also the company push you, as all these big companies do, sometimes to much, but that result in a bigger grown as developer in the good side, in the bad side, you start being burned, more-less when the salary will never be as good as it should be. Another very good thing I found in NGA is that they allow me to Work from home, it start with a couple of days, but with years I just fo to office a 4 days a month, with for me it’s the most valuable perk, because that way I can move with my family when needed (my wife works as public official and we move a lot)."

I think my dream job for sure should be a Frontend Job, I did some BE things but FE is my passion, so I prefer a company where I can use HTML, JS and CSS, don’t bother the JS FWK (is any) because I learn various of them though the year, and I really like to learn new things.\n\nWith my actual needs, I also for sure will need the remote work, or work at home. As said in the introduction we move a lot and working form home allow me to be with my family and spent many time with them. Is not I don’t want to go to the office, this days I miss the office and my partner in fact, and when we have a final city I will be pleased to go to the office but today is something we need as family.\n\nAnother important thing is the company should be dynamic, I mean, I already be trapped in an old library and the company should not let us to introduce new “things” and no just because are cool and new but because sometime could be a big step to ease the work.\n\nTeammates for sure are the more important thing in a company, because works can be very difficult some time, but if you have good teammates who support and help you, together you can go though all obstacles. I have the luck to work with excellent professionals and human beings and that for sure the most important thing to have in your company.\n\nFlexibility on work schedules it also something important for me, all of us sometimes have little things that break the daily routine and it’s nice the company listen you and allow to tackle them if needed.",
