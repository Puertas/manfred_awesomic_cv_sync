      "description": "Hello! My Name is Jose and I’m a Frontend Developer from Granada. \n\nAfter the first line with the TLDR; a bit of background about my professional life, I started my career working for NGA Human Resources in 2011. The company (the “tarugos” will call this a “carnica”) hired my as internship to help their Framework team, at that time FE FWK are not as usual as it today and they need a hand doing the shared component for EuHReka their HRIS platform. \n\nWe built shared component as a table with multiple function, a dynamic form connected with SAP Info-types, wizard, etc to do this we did our own CSS FWK (no bootstrap in the old times) and on JS side we start working with Prototype, old Jquery’s like library, and finally move to Jquery when became more popular. But mainly it old good plain JS, HTML and CSS\n\nIn NGA I work in more side project, like a Mobile version of EuHReka, we start using Backbone, and with the years move it to Cordova/Ionic.\n\nAfter the EuHReka, I join to the FWK team of a new project hrX, what pretend to be a connection between HRIS with a conversational HR bot. In the technical side we did it with Angular (formerly Angular 2+), our own version of Bootstrap and for “shared component” with other product we use WebComponent with Stencil.\n\nGood things I can say about NGA, but also my partners there are awesome, I really enjoy my time with them. Also the company push you, as all these big companies do, sometimes to much, but that result in a bigger grown as developer in the good side, in the bad side, you start being burned, more-less when the salary will never be as good as it should be. Another very good thing I found in NGA is that they allow me to Work from home, it start with a couple of days, but with years I just fo to office a 4 days a month, with for me it’s the most valuable perk, because that way I can move with my family when needed (my wife works as public official and we move a lot).\n\nIn 2018 being totally burn because my team at NGA it smaller day by day, I have more work that I can handle, and no body have time to sit with me and talk about the problems we have with the lack of developer (of course without a competitive salary) I decided to look for a new challenge, the only requisite I have is to maintain the work at home, which is not easy in this country, and finally move to a new company, Veleta Solutions, Spanish subsidiary of Swiss1Mobile.\n\nS1M is a little Swiss company that made “tailored handmade” solutions for SMEs. We are few developers, work like a little startup, we works in pairs (FE - BE), in the technical side we use Angular as FE for all projects, apart from did the code here, I also have to travel to Swiss sometimes a year to get direct feedback from clients or be with them some days and see how the work or use our products. Here a did a lot of projects in different areas, with is nice, for example made a little app to help a manager to generate letter for his stack-holders, create and app to manage boat and crews, or to did the inventory with scanners.\n\nAfter S1M I had a two-year stint working as a freelancer for Avallain. Avallain is a e-learning company where work on a content generator for education. From exams, interactive e-book generation, to the typical exercises at the end of a chapter in educational books for all ages. During this period I change the stack using React as the main framework, updating the older parts made in jQuery and creating new ones.\n\nMy last adventure is on Triggle as Front-end Lead. Apart for my usual development tasks (with React, Next, Jest, Cypress, Styled-components Node+Express ...) I'm also doing mentoring for the new and juniors members of the team, trying to share with them good practices and JS knowledge, and of course learning a lot from them also. I'm also more actively helping on management and decision taking in front-end related tasks.\n\nThat’s about my professional background, I already speak something about what tools and language I use as developer, but about my “likes” I have to say that I know lot of people dislike JavaScript but I really like it, I know can be a mess, but also it’s very flexible and that match with me, and you can do very good code in JS if you have the knowledge and learn about good practice, other languages ensure that you have to follow, but this lack on JS make you have to read and be up to date, and that is a good things.\n\nAlso love CSS, I spent a lot of time “fighting” with it in the old times, with Internet Explorer 6 in all his gracious, but that endure you, I know can be difficult and frustrating sometimes, but again at the end it’s a very handy tool for designing UIs.\n\nFar from works and keyboard, I’m the husband of an incredible woman, Elia, and also the father of a little “devil” Alejandro who is the joy or our life’s. They are the more important thing in my life and I always try to be with them as much as possible, I decline lot of offer from other cities and countries, even very good one, because I want to be with my family everyday, don’t want to just see them on weekends or things like that.\n\nMy hobbies are, apart from coding, because we developer sure are crazy, are Swimming, Basketball and video games. \n\nI try to go swimming 3 days a week, and swim about 1,5km each. Swimming is the sport that most disconnects me from work and put my brain in new clear state, if I have a bad day and my head is full of work problem I just start swimming and when I finish it's gone. \n\nI play basketball since I was 5, it's my favourite sport, but today It's difficult to play it, have no time or people don't want to join me, you know football country, so I have to settle watching the NBA.\n\nAbout video games, I like it a lot since I was a kid playing with a SNES. I'm and old school player and prefer the single player games, like God of war, The last of us or Dark Souls. I spent less time that I want here, because Alejandro don't let us a lot of free time, but I will wait for the retirement.\n\nAlso I like technology in general, read articles and listen podcasts about it, also have to admit that I have a problem with Mechanical Keyboards and always is a good time to buy a new one with that new switch everybody is talking about.\n\nAnother of my favourite thing in life is travel. I have the luck to travel a lot but always less than I like, with the baby we have to pause a bit our travels, but we are willing to take a plane and look for a new country. \n\nI think that's all, hope this \"introduction\" it's not to big, and thanks all for the time",
